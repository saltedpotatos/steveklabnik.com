It’s been a long journey. I have a lot to say about this, but it’ll have to wait until I’m not in the middle of nowhere spending some time with Maria’s family. I just wanted to tell you all Merry Christmas, and point you at the [Hackety Hack v1.0 release announcement](http://blog.hackety-hack.com/post/2457961910/merry-christmas-and-a-1-0-announcement) and the new [Hackety Hack website](http://hackety-hack.com/).

Merry Christmas!
