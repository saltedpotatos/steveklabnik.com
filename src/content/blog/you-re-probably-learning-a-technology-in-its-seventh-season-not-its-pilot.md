title: You're probably learning a technology in its seventh season, not its pilot

I first heard this adage in the Rails space. I don't know who to attribute this
to, but I also never wrote it down. So, time to write it down, and if you know
of the origin of this aphorism, let me know and I'd love to put it here!

I *think* that the first formulation of this sentiment goes something like this:

> Rails is like a soap opera. You're getting started with it in a later season.
> The cast of characters has already been established, there's a lot of history.
> You kinda just gotta dive in and go with the flow and catch up on older stuff
> at your leasure.

That's obviously a bit long, so I think I'll be using something like this
in the future:

> You're probably learning a technology in its seventh season, not its pilot.

I was thinking about this today because I happened to come across [this reddit post from a few months ago][reddit-post].

> > In fact, there is hardly any analysis of the downsides of Rustâ€™s error model in the first place, which is quite disheartening.

Now, I don't want to take a position on the original thread, or what they have
to say, or if they actually *are* falling afoul of this aphorism. But I think
that this particular text shows the meaning of what I mean by "you're in the
seventh season" beautifully. Sometimes, when we learn a new technology, we go
"wtf, why is this like this?" And sometimes, that outside perspective is good!
But sometimes, it just means that you weren't there for the discussion, you either
don't know or aren't in the same contexts, or a variety of other reasons why
something is the way that it is, even if that way is surprising to you at first.

In that sense, I think this idea is pretty closely related to Chesterton's Fence.
It may even just be the same thing, formulated in a slightly different way.
