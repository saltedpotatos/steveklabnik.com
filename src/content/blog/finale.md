This morning, my mother woke up and found that my father had passed away in the night.

Thanks for all the love and support you all have shown me over the last two months. It’s been hard, but you all have made it easier.

Don’t be worried if you don’t see me around a lot for the next few days. Just trying to take some time off from the hustle to help my family heal. And to just play video games and be a bit mindless.

No, seriously. Thank you.
