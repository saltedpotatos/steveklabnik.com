I’m happy to bring you some news: [“The Rust Programming Language”](http://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) is going to be published, in physical form, by [No Starch Press](https://www.nostarch.com/). I am really excited to work with No Starch on this: they’ve published some of my favorite programming books, like [“If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript”](https://www.nostarch.com/hemingway), [“Ruby Under a Microscope”](https://www.nostarch.com/rum), and [“Ruby Wizardry”](https://www.nostarch.com/rubywizardry).

Another reason I’m keen to work with No Starch on this is that they believe in publishing freely available material: we’re going to take the existing manuscript, whip it into shape, make a nice paper book out of it, and merge the changes back into the official documentation. So the improvements will get back to everyone, even those who can’t afford a physical copy.

The authorship credit is to “The Rust Project Developers,” as other people have contributed significantly: we even have an [active PR to re-write an entire chapter](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/28301). Rust is a team effort.

Oh, and one last thing: the profit from the book won’t go to me, it will go to [OpenHatch](http://openhatch.org/), “a non-profit dedicated to matching prospective free software contributors with communities, tools, and education,” to use their words about it.

I’ll let you know when we’re closer to actually shipping!
