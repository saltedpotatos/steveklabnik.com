“The people are unstoppable / Another world is possible”

This has long been my favorite protest chant. For me, it gets to the heart of the matter: another world *is* possible. If I’m honest with myself, most days, I don’t really believe that the world will get better. We often present history as a kind of positive progression: the world has only been getting better, more tolerant, and less poor as the years go by. I don’t *feel* that, though. What I see is imperialism, consolidation of power, and rampant racism/sexism/etc. Liberalism presents itself as an end of history, the final stop on the line. That’s unacceptable to me, but I usually feel like the only one.

The start of this post sounds depressing, but I’m only writing it because I actually feel positive, invigorated. I’m writing this post from the Barcelona airport, about to board the plane home. It took me a while to figure this out, but what I realized is this: getting out of the US every once in a while really helps me feel better. This isn’t to say that things are actually *better* in other places, that’s not my point. My point is that It’s not something like “European-style parlamentary democracy is better than a bicameral legislature” or something like that, just look at the UK election results. It’s that the street signs are different. The money isn’t the same. Familiar foods have changes. I see 漢字 instead of the Latin alphabet. Whatever is unusual about whatever part of the world I am in, it’s the smallest differences that have the largest impact on me and my state of mind.

When I go somewhere else, I can *feel* the difference. And difference is possibility. And possibility is hope, for a better world, for a better humanity.
