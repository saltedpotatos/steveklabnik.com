I’m going vim-gan. Basically, I don’t want to consume any source code which doesn’t come from vim, or products that contain non-vim source code.

While I won’t, some people I’ve talked to will also consume code produced in Eclipse, since recent scientific studies show that Eclipse users can’t actually feel pain. This is enough of an ethical gray area that I’m staying away from it, but I can see that perspective.

I just can’t stay silent while the software industry brutalizes source code like this. Not cool, everyone.
