I’ve been thinking about this post for a while.

I freaking love Hacker News. It’s my favorite place on the Internet. It’s incredibly valuable. I have learned so much from my time there. With that said, I feel like it’s taken up too much of my time.

I’m trying to accomplish things. I got accepted to grad school. I’m trying to rebuild Shoes. I’m working on improving Hackety. I’m finding that I don’t have enough hours in the day to accomplish the things I want to accomplish. And arguing for the hundredth time about how artists will survive in a post-IP world, or how to get your first couple of users, or whatever it is that Google or Apple did this week hasn’t gotten boring yet, and that’s a problem.

The only respectable solution is to go cold-turkey for a while.

I’ve been doing good on some of my new years’ resolutions, and bad on others. I haven’t spent a lot of time writing lately, and I have only been doing okay at my writing. Hacker News is cutting into that. I feel like I’m using it in the same way some use TV. Yeah, it’s significantly deeper, but I really should be reading more books and less HN. At least, that’s what’s right for me right now.

I won’t be gone forever. I just need to spend more time elsewhere.

With that said, I’ve been spending a *lot* of time on Shoes. I’ll just leave this here: [https://github.com/shoes/shoes/tree/feature/gemify](https://github.com/shoes/shoes/tree/feature/gemify)
