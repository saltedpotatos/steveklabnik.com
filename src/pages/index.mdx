<div className="prose prose-slate">

You may know me from my work on [Rust][rust], or maybe even the stuff I did with
[Ruby on Rails][rails-commits] back in the day.

You might have read [a post I wrote][blog], or maybe even a chapter or two of
[The Rust Programming Language][trpl].

Maybe you saw a conference talk of mine, or saw one of my (too many,frankly)
[tweets][twitter]. I have left Twitter, and now post [on BlueSky][bsky].

It's also possible that you've used some code I've developed [on GitHub][github].

Anyway, hi, ðŸ‘‹. I'm Steve.
