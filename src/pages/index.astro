      <p>
        You may know me from my work on <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a>
        , or maybe even the stuff I did with
        <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/steve-klabnik/commits">
          Ruby on Rails
        </a>
        back in the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might have read <a href="/writing">a post I wrote</a>, or maybe even a chapter or two of
        <em>
          <a href="https://nostarch.com/Rust">The Rust Programming Language</a>
        </em>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe you saw a conference talk of mine, or saw one of my (too many,
        frankly) <a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">tweets</a>. I have
        left Twitter, and now post <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steveklabnik.com"> on BlueSky</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also possible that you've used some code I've developed
        <a href="https://github.com/steveklabnik">on GitHub</a>.
      </p>
